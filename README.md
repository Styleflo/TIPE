Oriented sub-gradient algorithm for the study of compatible multiflots

This work was made for my TIPE, a projet that I needed to present to pass my exams. It shows with a certain distribution of a network if there is an optimal routage that satisfy every communications. This is equivalent to finding the optimum on a simplex.
